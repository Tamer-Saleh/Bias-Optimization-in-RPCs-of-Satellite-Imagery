# 3D-Reconstruction-by-RFM
Optimaizing Bias in RPCs by Matlab 

We provide here some matlab codes of 2D-3D image/object coordinates using the rational function model (RFM) algorithm. All these codes are used in our experimenets.


If you have some problems or find some bugs in the codes, please email: tamer.mohamed@feng.bu.edu.eg
