# Bias Optimization in RPCs of Satellite Imagery by Matlab

We provide here some matlab codes of 2D-3D image/object coordinates using the rational function model (RFM) algorithm. All these codes were used in our experimenets. Put your ground control points (GCPs) in WGS84_Obse_Sample.txt and the coordinates of these points on the two images (left and right) in MIC_L_Sample.txt and MIC_R_Sample.txt. Also, extract the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) supplied with the images in Coeff.txt. You can get the results by running Ours-2D-3D-First-Order.m. 

If you have some problems or find some bugs in the codes, please send an email to: tamer.mohamed@feng.bu.edu.eg or tamersaleh@whu.edu.cn
